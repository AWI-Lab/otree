	You are <b>Player B</b>.
	</p>
	<p>
		You may now decide how many of your points to send to Player A. You can choose any number of points between 0 and 100.</p>

	<p><em>Recall:<br>
	Both players start out with 100 points each.<br>
If the color of the ball drawn from the virtual urn is the same as the winning color, you win the lottery and receive an extra 300 points.<br>
If the color of the ball drawn from the virtual urn is not the same as the winning color, you do not win the lottery and receive an extra 100 points.</em></p>
